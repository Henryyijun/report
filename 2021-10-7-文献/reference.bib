The regularization functional in the model carries prior knowledge about the image to be restored. The prior knowledge, in particular for natural images, are the first-order (i.e. variance in luminance) and second-order (i.e. contrast and texture) information. In this paper, we propose a model for image restoration, using a multilevel non-stationary tight framelet system that can capture the image's first-order and second-order information. We develop an algorithm to solve the proposed model and the numerical experiments show that the model is effective and efficient as compared to other higher-order models.},

  abstract    = {In this paper, the problem of Magnetic Resonance (MR) image reconstruction from partial Fourier samples has been considered. To this aim, we leverage the evidence that MR images are sparser than their zero-filled reconstructed ones from incomplete Fourier samples. This information can be used to define an optimization problem which searches for the sparsest possible image conforming with the available Fourier samples. We solve the resulting problem using the well-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Unlike most existing methods that work with small over-lapping image patches, the proposed algorithm considers the whole image without dividing it into small blocks. Experimental results prominently confirm its promising performance and advantages over the existing methods.},

  title       = {Compressed Sensing Parallel MRI with Adaptive Shrinkage TV Regularization},
  abstract    = {Compressed sensing (CS) methods in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer rapid acquisition and improved image quality but require iterative reconstruction schemes with regularization to enforce sparsity. Regardless of the difficulty in obtaining a fast numerical solution, the total variation (TV) regularization is a preferred choice due to its edge-preserving and structure recovery capabilities. While many approaches have been proposed to overcome the non-differentiability of the TV cost term, an iterative shrinkage based formulation allows recovering an image through recursive application of linear filtering and soft thresholding. However, providing an optimal setting for the regularization parameter is critical due to its direct impact on the rate of convergence as well as steady state error. In this paper, a regularizer adaptively varying in the derivative space is proposed, that follows the generalized discrepancy principle (GDP). The implementation proceeds by adaptively reducing the discrepancy level expressed as the absolute difference between TV norms of the consistency error and the sparse approximation error. A criterion based on the absolute difference between TV norms of consistency and sparse approximation errors is used to update the threshold. Application of the adaptive shrinkage TV regularizer to CS recovery of parallel MRI (pMRI) and temporal gradient adaptation in dynamic MRI are shown to result in improved image quality with accelerated convergence. In addition, the adaptive TV-based iterative shrinkage (ATVIS) provides a significant speed advantage over the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA).},

abstract = {Sparse sampling and parallel imaging techniques are two effective approaches to alleviate the lengthy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquisition problem. Promising data recoveries can be obtained from a few MRI samples with the help of sparse reconstruction models. To solve the optimization models, proper algorithms are indispensable. The pFISTA, a simple and efficient algorithm, has been successfully extended to parallel imaging. However, its convergence criterion is still an open question. Besides, the existing convergence criterion of single-coil pFISTA cannot be applied to the parallel imaging pFISTA, which, therefore, imposes confusions and difficulties on users about determining the only parameter - step size. In this work, we provide the guaranteed convergence analysis of the parallel imaging version pFISTA to solve the two well-known parallel imaging reconstruction models, SENSE and SPIRiT. Along with the convergence analysis, we provide recommended step size values for SENSE and SPIRiT reconstructions to obtain fast and promising reconstructions. Experiments on in vivo brain images demonstrate the validity of the convergence criterion.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-channel image reconstruction method, named DeepcomplexMRI, to accelerate parallel MR imaging with residual complex convolutional neural network. Different from most existing works which rely on the utilization of the coil sensitivities or prior information of predefined transforms, DeepcomplexMRI takes advantage of the availability of a large number of existing multi-channel groudtruth images and uses them as target data to train the deep residual convolutional neural network offline. In particular, a complex convolutional network is proposed to take into account the correlation between the real and imaginary parts of MR images. In addition, the k-space data consistency is further enforced repeatedly in between layers of the network. The evaluations on in vivo datasets show that the proposed method has the capability to recover the desired multi-channel images. Its comparison with state-of-the-art methods also demonstrates that the proposed method can reconstruct the desired MR images more accurately.}

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging has been widely applied in clinical diagnosis. However, it is limited by its long data acquisition time. Although the imaging can be accelerated by sparse sampling and parallel imaging, achieving promising reconstructed images with a fast computation speed remains a challenge. Recently, deep learning methods have attracted a lot of attention for encouraging reconstruction results, but they are lack of proper interpretability for neural networks. In this work, in order to enable high-quality image reconstruction for the parallel magnetic resonance imaging, we design the network structure from the perspective of sparse iterative reconstruction and enhance it with the residual structure. Experimental results on a public knee dataset indicate that, as compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning-based and optimization-based methods, the proposed network achieves lower error in reconstruction and is more robust under different samplings.}

abstract = {Variational regularization models are one of the popular and efficient approaches for image restoration. The regularization functional in the model carries prior knowledge about the image to be restored. The prior knowledge, in particular for natural images, are the first-order (i.e. variance in luminance) and second-order (i.e. contrast and texture) information. In this paper, we propose a model for image restoration, using a multilevel non-stationary tight framelet system that can capture the image's first-order and second-order information. We develop an algorithm to solve the proposed model and the numerical experiments show that the model is effective and efficient as compared to other higher-order models.}
